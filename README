PLEASE READ THE INSTALL SECTION COMPLETELY.

- This plugin generates a list of NT services that are installed on the
  local NT/W2K/XP machine with the current started status. You can
  start/stop the service by pressing S or pause/continue the service by
  pressing P on the corresponding entry.
- You can open the servicelist window through WinManager (as described in
  the installation section below) or by assigning a hot key. You can use
  the same hot key to open/close the window. Alternatively, you can also
  use the :NTServices command to open/close the services window.
- You can choose which fields that you want to see by using the
  NtsFields command. You can select the sort fields by pressing s
  consecutively and r for reversing the sort direction.
- If you have permissions, you can view the service list in a remote m/c
  by using the NtsSetHost command. With no arguments, it prints the
  current remote host name. To switch back to the local m/c, use "." for
  the host name.
- For the sake of speed, the list of services is cached. To see the latest
  set of services and their states at any time, refresh the window by
  pressing 'R'.
- It requires multvals and genutils plugins to be always installed, but
  others are required only depending on your usage/setting (for a better
  experience and formatting).
